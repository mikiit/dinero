-- Receipt photos: a PRIVATE storage bucket where every object lives under
-- a folder named after its owner's user id ("<user_id>/<transaction_id>/
-- <uuid>.jpg"). The policies below are the actual access control - the app
-- never sees another user's receipts because Postgres won't show them.
-- transactions.receipt_url stores the object PATH (not a URL); the app turns
-- it into a short-lived signed URL when it needs to display the image.
--
-- Safe to run by hand in the SQL editor and again via `supabase db push`.
